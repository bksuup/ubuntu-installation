# ubuntu-installation

Opinionated setup of Ubuntu. Based on Basecamp's Omakub

Most of the general logic behind the install-process is taken directly from [Omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub), but the package choices and a lot of the install-steps have been created from scratch. Also, as i am a platform engineer, most of the web-development stuff has been dropped and replaced with what i use when working with Azure.

## TODO

- [ ] Make Azure / Cloud related packages optional for non Public Cloud users
- [ ] Choose between default Ubuntu setup, or "riced" with Gnome extensions
